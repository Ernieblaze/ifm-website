# Iwhuruohna First Movement (IFM) — Website Project Plan

> **Source of truth for this repo.** Claude Code should read this file at the start of every session to stay aligned on architecture, decisions, and build order. Update it whenever a major decision changes.

---

## 1. Project overview

A professional, mobile-first website for the **Iwhuruohna FIRST Movement (IFM)** — a nationalist movement founded **10 Nov 2018**, headquartered in **Port Harcourt, Rivers State**, devoted to protecting the Iwhuruohna woman, man, and child under the motto **"Unity, Loyalty, Duty."**

**The site exists to do five jobs. Every feature must serve at least one:**

1. **Unite** — a digital home for Iwhuruohna people everywhere.
2. **Preserve** — protect the history, origin narrative, language, and traditions.
3. **Inform** — publish movement updates, events, and announcements.
4. **Amplify voices** — let members share their own stories.
5. **Project globally** — a polished face that makes IFM stand out beyond Rivers State.

**Real, approved copy is locked in** for the Hero, About, Mission, Core Values, Stats band, "What We Do" programs (homepage and the full `/programs` page), Leadership, Join CTA, and the Our Story intro and founding milestone (see `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/about/page.tsx`, `src/app/programs/page.tsx`, and `src/app/history/page.tsx`). News, Articles, and Events remain Phase 1 placeholders; Our Story has three placeholder milestones pending confirmed details; the Programs page is missing event dates and photos for its programs; Gallery has real photos but placeholder captions — see §12.

## 2. Locked decisions

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | **Next.js (App Router)** |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS** |
| Backend (DB + Auth + Storage) | **Supabase** |
| Version control | **GitHub** |
| Hosting | **Vercel (Hobby / free)** |
| Launch strategy | **Static core pages first**, then add Supabase + admin |
| Login (phase 1) | **Admin-only.** Members read freely and submit stories via a form. Public accounts can be added later with minimal rework. |
| Budget | **₦0.** Custom domain is the only optional paid upgrade later. |

---

## 3. Tech stack & why

- **Next.js (App Router):** fast, SEO-friendly (critical for global reach — search engines must read the History pages), deploys natively on Vercel.
- **Tailwind CSS:** custom, consistent, professional styling built quickly.
- **Supabase:** one free service providing the Postgres database (posts/events/stories), authentication (admin login), and file storage (images). This is what powers "admin posts updates from the back end."
- **Vercel:** auto-deploys on every push to GitHub; free Hobby tier is fine for a community/non-profit site.

**Known free-tier caveat:** Supabase pauses a project after ~7 days of *inactivity*. An active site won't hit this; if it ever pauses, opening the dashboard resumes it.

## 5. Sitemap & pages

| Page | Purpose | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| **Home** | Full multi-section page, real copy locked in: Hero (leader portrait) → About → Mission → Core Values (6) → Stats band → What We Do (4 programs) → Leadership → News preview → Articles preview → History teaser → Events preview → Join CTA → Gallery teaser | 1 |
| **About / The Movement** | Mission, "Iwhuruohna First" philosophy, rejection of political tokenism, industrialization vision, leadership | 1 |
| **Programs** (`/programs`) | Full detail on the five confirmed programs (`programs` array in `src/app/programs/page.tsx`): Cultural Revival and Miss IFM, Student Debates, School Outreach, Women and Girl Child Empowerment, Industrialization Agenda. Real, confirmed copy throughout, no invented dates, locations, or numbers. The homepage's abbreviated "What We Do" section links here via "View all programs." Ends with the shared `JoinCtaBand`. Event dates and photos for these programs are still pending. | 1 |
| **Our Story** (`/history`, nav labeled "Our Story") | Real, confirmed copy: founding in Port Harcourt on 10 November 2018, the movement's purpose, and a data-driven vertical timeline (`milestones` array in `src/app/history/page.tsx`). Only the founding entry is real; three placeholder milestone slots (visually muted, dashed) are waiting on confirmed dates and details from group records, not invented. Ends with the shared `JoinCtaBand`. | 1 |
| **News & Updates** | List of movement announcements (placeholder content in Phase 1; list + individual post pages once admin-published in Phase 2) | 1 (static) → 2 (dynamic) |
| **Articles** | Longer-form editorial pieces on history, culture, and philosophy (placeholder content in Phase 1; list + individual article pages once dynamic) | 1 (static) → 2 (dynamic) |
| **Events** | Upcoming + past events, auto-sorted. Neutral placeholder ("Event N", "Details coming soon"); no photos here, this section is for dated events only once real titles/dates/locations/status are confirmed. | 1 (static) → 2 (dynamic) |
| **Join / Register** | Public member registration form; shows a live member count once wired to Supabase | 1 (static form) → 2 (persisted + live count) |
| **Contact** | Form + social links (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube) | 1 |
| **Stories / Voices** | Member-submitted stories (admin-approved before publishing) + submission form | 2 |
| **Gallery** | Photos/videos grouped into albums. Six real photos live (`public/images/gallery-1.jpg` to `gallery-6.jpg`, places the movement has been and things it has done) on both `/gallery` and the homepage teaser; albums/captions still to come. | 1 (photos) → 3 (albums) |
| **Admin dashboard** | Login-protected back end for managing all dynamic content | 2 |

## 6. Feature list

**Public (mostly static / read-only):**
- Fast, mobile-first pages with strong cultural imagery.
- Rich homepage: mission strip, About teaser, live-style member stats, News/Articles/Events previews, Join CTA, gallery teaser.
- News feed that updates instantly when admin publishes (no redeploy) — Phase 1 ships with placeholder content.
- Articles (long-form editorial) list + individual pages — Phase 1 ships with placeholder content.
- Event listings (upcoming vs. past) — Phase 1 ships with placeholder content.
- Public member registration (`/join`) with a displayed member count — Phase 1 form is client-only; Phase 2 persists to Supabase and the count goes live.
- Story submission form → enters admin approval queue.
- Media gallery with albums; homepage carries a teaser grid until real photography lands.
- Social embeds (Facebook / YouTube) to reinforce existing pages.
- Optional newsletter email capture (for diaspora reach later).
- SEO: meta tags, Open Graph image, sitemap, semantic HTML.

**Admin (login-protected, phase 2):**
- Email + password login (Supabase Auth).
- Create / edit / delete: news posts, articles, events, gallery items.
- Approve / reject member story submissions.
- View / manage registered members.
- Upload images (Supabase Storage).

## 7. Data model (Supabase) — for phase 2

Tables (snake_case). Use Row Level Security (RLS).

**`posts`** (news/updates)
- `id` uuid pk, `title` text, `slug` text unique, `excerpt` text, `body` text, `cover_image_url` text, `published` bool default false, `created_at` timestamptz, `updated_at` timestamptz

**`events`**
- `id` uuid pk, `title` text, `description` text, `location` text, `event_date` timestamptz, `cover_image_url` text, `published` bool default false, `created_at` timestamptz

**`articles`** (long-form editorial)
- `id` uuid pk, `title` text, `slug` text unique, `excerpt` text, `body` text, `author` text, `cover_image_url` text, `published` bool default false, `created_at` timestamptz, `updated_at` timestamptz

**`members`** (public registrations from `/join`)
- `id` uuid pk, `name` text, `email` text unique, `location` text, `note` text, `created_at` timestamptz

**`stories`** (member submissions)
- `id` uuid pk, `author_name` text, `author_contact` text, `title` text, `body` text, `image_url` text, `status` text default `'pending'` (`pending` | `approved` | `rejected`), `created_at` timestamptz

**`gallery_items`**
- `id` uuid pk, `title` text, `media_url` text, `media_type` text (`image` | `video`), `album` text, `created_at` timestamptz

**`subscribers`** (optional newsletter)
- `id` uuid pk, `email` text unique, `created_at` timestamptz

**RLS policy intent:**
- Anonymous (public) can **SELECT** rows where `published = true` (posts/events/articles), `status = 'approved'` (stories), and all `gallery_items`.
- Anonymous can **INSERT** into `stories` (submissions), `subscribers`, and `members` (registration) only. `members` should not be publicly readable beyond an aggregate count (expose via a count-only RPC/view, not direct table SELECT).
- Authenticated admins can do **everything** (full read/write/delete).

**Storage:** one public-read bucket (e.g. `media`) for images; write restricted to authenticated users.

**Auth:** Supabase email/password. Admins are added manually in the Supabase dashboard (no public sign-up in phase 1).

---

## 8. Admin & login approach

- Phase 1 ships with **no login** — fully static, immediately useful and shareable.
- Phase 2 adds `/admin/login`. After login, `/admin/dashboard` exposes content management.
- Only a small set of trusted admins exist; they're created directly in Supabase.
- Visitors never need accounts. Story submissions go through a public form → admin approves.
- **Future option:** public member accounts (profiles, members-only area, comments) can be added later — Supabase Auth supports it without re-architecting.

---

## 9. Design system

**Direction:** professional, modern, identity-rooted — not a generic template. Mobile-first.

**Colors (locked):** defined as CSS variables + Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens in `src/app/globals.css`, with a warm dark-mode variant (never cold gray):
- `brand-green` `#0A6B37` (light) / `#22B567` (dark) — anchor accent; gets real "moments of dominance" (hero, CTA band, About-teaser white band's icon accents) but never an everywhere-default
- `accent-green` `#129A4C` (light) / `#3DD686` (dark) — hover/lighter step
- `gold` `#C68A2E` (light) / `#D9A53F` (dark) — heritage accent, used for eyebrows/kickers
- `brand-red` `#E11D2A` (light) / `#FF4B57` (dark) — strong emphasis only (primary CTA, key links); the homepage Join/Register CTA button is red, not gold, to keep this rule consistent
- `cream` `#FAF6EC` — dominant background
- `white` / `surface` `#FFFFFF` (light) — cards and the About-teaser band sit on crisp white so they visibly lift off the cream
- `ink` `#14130F` — body text
- Semantic tokens (`background`, `foreground`, `surface`, `surface-muted`, `border`, `muted-foreground`, `ring`) swap per light/dark via `.dark` class, toggled with `next-themes`.
- Section-level color rotation: the homepage mission strip (Preserve/Unite/Inform/Empower) deliberately rotates icon tone across green/gold/red instead of repeating green on every icon.

**Typography (locked):**
- Headings: **Fraunces** (serif) via `next/font/google`, mapped to `font-heading`.
- Body/UI: **Inter** via `next/font/google`, mapped to default `font-sans`.
- "Iwhuruohna" never breaks mid-word in headings (`.no-break` + `text-wrap: balance` on headings).

**Copy style (locked):** no em dashes, en dashes, ampersands, or middots in visible site copy (headings, eyebrows, stats, cards, CTAs, toasts). Join clauses with a period, a comma, or "and" instead, e.g. "Iwhuruohna FIRST Movement. Est. 2018" not "... · Est. 2018", "Women and Girl-Child" not "Women & Girl-Child". Arrow glyphs (e.g. "Read more →") are fine; this rule is about dash/slash/ampersand punctuation reading as AI-generated, not all special characters. PLAN.md itself isn't held to this (it's internal documentation, not site copy).

**Component libraries (locked):**
- **shadcn/ui pattern + Radix primitives** (owned source, not a runtime dep) for Button, Input, Textarea, Label, Tabs, Tooltip, Dialog, Sheet, Dropdown Menu — in `src/components/ui/`.
- **framer-motion** for scroll-reveal (`Reveal`, `Stagger`/`StaggerItem`), hover/press elevation on cards and buttons, the one quiet hero float, and route transitions (`PageTransition`) — fast (200–500ms), ease-out, no bounce.
- **lucide-react** for all icons.
- **sonner** for toast feedback on forms.
- `JoinCtaBand` (`src/components/JoinCtaBand.tsx`) is the single source of truth for the green "Iwhuruohna FIRST." closing CTA band; reused on the homepage and Our Story rather than duplicated. New pages that want a closing CTA should reuse it too.

**Motion conventions (locked, `src/components/motion/`):**
- `Reveal` — single-block fade/slide-in, triggers once via `whileInView`.
- `Stagger` + `StaggerItem` — wrap card grids/lists for a cascading reveal (`staggerChildren`); use instead of manually offsetting `Reveal` delays.
- `Counter` — scroll-triggered count-up for stats; jumps straight to the final value under reduced motion.
- `PageTransition` — wraps `{children}` in the root layout for a quick cross-fade between routes.
- The hero's `HeroMark` is the **only** continuous/looping animation on the site (slow vertical float) — no other looping motion.
- The whole app is wrapped in `<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">` (`src/app/layout.tsx`) so transform/loop animations are automatically disabled for users with `prefers-reduced-motion` set; opacity fades still play.

**Layout principles:**
- Full-width hero, cream-dominant with sparse green/gold accent marks (no solid green blocks).
- A subtle geometric pattern motif (`PatternDivider`) used sparingly as a section divider.
- Generous spacing; dignified, not corporate-cold.
- Mobile excellence before desktop; phone nav uses a slide-in Sheet. The navbar wordmark always shows the full "Iwhuruohna First Movement" (logo shrinks and text wraps to two lines on narrow screens instead of truncating).
- All interactive controls keep a minimum 44×44px touch target (nav icons, theme toggle, sheet/dialog close, tabs, social icons).
- Imagery-forward sections (festivals, pageants, wrestling, gatherings, the flag) once real photography is provided — see §12.
- Leader portraits (hero + `LeaderCard`) are transparent-background PNG cutouts placed directly on a soft blurred brand-green gradient backdrop, no card, box, or clipping frame behind them, just a `drop-shadow` for lift and a bottom mask-fade so the photo blends into the section. Hero portrait is sized 224 to 320px (mobile to desktop); name is bold, title is a lighter weight beneath it.

## 10. Build roadmap

**Phase 1 — Static core (launch target)**
1. Scaffold Next.js + Tailwind; init GitHub repo; first deploy to Vercel (live URL day one).
2. Build Navbar + Footer + design tokens (colors/fonts from flag).
3. Build Home, About, History, Contact (content hard-coded for now).
4. Build the full multi-section homepage, plus News, Articles, Events, and Join pages with placeholder content (`src/lib/placeholder-data.ts`) — all marked with `TODO(supabase)` for Phase 2.
5. SEO basics + Open Graph image. **→ Ship & share.**

**Phase 2 — Backend + admin**
6. Create Supabase project; add tables (incl. `articles`, `members`), RLS, storage bucket; wire env vars.
7. Build admin login + dashboard.
8. Convert News, Articles, and Events to dynamic (read from Supabase); replace `placeholder-data.ts`.
9. Persist `/join` registrations to `members`; show a live member count on the homepage stats band.
10. Build Stories page + submission form + approval flow.

**Phase 3 — Polish & grow**
11. Gallery + albums (replace homepage teaser); social embeds.
12. Newsletter capture; Get Involved page.
13. Performance + accessibility + final design pass.
14. (Optional) custom domain.

## 11. Environment setup

```bash
# Phase 1
npx create-next-app@latest ifm-website --typescript --tailwind --app
cd ifm-website
git init && git add . && git commit -m "init"
# create GitHub repo, push, then import into Vercel

# Phase 2 — Supabase
npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/ssr
```

**`.env.local`** (never commit):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...   # server-side only, never exposed to the browser
```
Add the same variables in **Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**.

## 12. Assets & content needed from the team

- [x] **Logo** — official crest (`public/images/logo.png`, transparent PNG) is in use in the Navbar, Footer, and as the site favicon (`src/app/icon.png`, a 512×512 padded square crop generated from the source crest so it isn't squished in browser tabs)
- [ ] Iwhuruohna **flag** image — still needed to finalize/confirm the color palette (current palette is a placeholder direction, not yet flag-derived)
- [x] **Mission statement** + "Who We Are" / About copy — real, approved copy is live on the homepage and About page (see §1)
- [x] **Our Story intro and founding milestone** — real copy live on `/history` (founding in Port Harcourt, 10 November 2018, the movement's purpose, Unity Loyalty Duty)
- [ ] **Three more confirmed milestones** for the Our Story timeline (`milestones` array in `src/app/history/page.tsx`); currently dashed, muted placeholder slots, no invented dates or claims
- [x] **Programs detail page** — `/programs` live with the five confirmed programs (`src/app/programs/page.tsx`)
- [ ] **Program event dates and photos** — each program on `/programs` (Cultural Revival and Miss IFM, Student Debates, School Outreach, Women and Girl Child Empowerment, Industrialization Agenda) still needs specific event dates and cleared photos
- [x] **Gallery photos** — six images live at `public/images/gallery-1.jpg` to `gallery-6.jpg`, shown on `/gallery` and the homepage Gallery teaser (`src/lib/placeholder-data.ts`). These are general movement photos, not tied to dated events. Real captions and album groupings are still needed.
- [ ] **Dated event details** — `/events` is back to a neutral placeholder ("Event N", "Details coming soon"); needs real titles, dates, locations, and past/upcoming status, plus its own photos once available
- [ ] **Photos** cleared for use (culture, people, more events)
- [x] **Leadership** — first leader live: Emeka Ihruoha, IFM Supreme Leader (`public/images/leader.png`, a transparent-background cutout; `src/lib/leaders-data.ts`). Shown in the Home hero, a homepage Leadership section, and reused inside the About page's Leadership tab via `LeadershipSection`/`LeaderCard`. Each leader has a placeholder for a short message/quote until supplied — more leaders can be added by extending the `LEADERS` array.
- [ ] **Social links** (Facebook page, Instagram, YouTube)
- [ ] Number of **admins** needing login access
